# Node and Express for HW1

You can use this example file as your starting point, if you're having trouble with the build files in class.

Clone the project wherever you like. CD into the project, and NPM install

Run NPM start, or node app - either way, you should get an instance running on localhost:3000

To compile the SASS you can write **sass --watch sass:public/css --style compressed** in a terminal window. That will compile all of your sass to the public/css folder

Remember - you don't have to include the /public part of your static asset resource paths. css/main.css or images/name_of_image is fine.

We're just sending index.html back via the main route, so build your project in that file as before and you should be good to go!

Remember to add the node.js buildpack on Heroku, and include the live Heroku link with your submission.

Cheers!
